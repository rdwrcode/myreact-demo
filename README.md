This project is to use several libraries related to react by putting them into a simple app.
Everything is a _react_ **component**.

It features the usage of 
* [React-router v4](https://react-router-website-uxmsaeusnn.now.sh/quick-start)
* [React-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion)
* [React-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd)
* Add [Rubix](https://github.com/Zacqary/rubix) with CSS animation, Redux, and React-Saga.

## Additional npm packages:
```
npm i -D eslint eslint-plugin-react
npm i -S redux-saga babel-eslint babel-polyfill document-register-element
``` 
All the basics of react are just buried in the code.
