# myreact-demo
This project is to use several libraries related to react by putting them into a simple app.
Everything is a _react_ **component**.

## step-0-creation 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```
npm i -g create-react-app
create-react-app myreact-demo 
```

## step-1-route
Several components are going to be built with different libraries. It is neat to separate them into several pages with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

```
npm i -S react-router
```

## step-2-routerv4
[React router v4](https://react-router-website-uxmsaeusnn.now.sh/quick-start) is still in alpha. It is so simple. There are two routes, Home and About. 
More details are here [React-router v4 FAQ](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v4).
```
npm i -S react-router@next
```

## step-3-visualization
Try react-vis. 
```
npm i -S react-vis react-addons-shallow-compare
```

## step-4-visualization
Try victory
```
npm i -S victory
```

## step-5-basics
Add some basic exercises of react.

## step-6-show
Add animated buttons with react-motion.
```
npm i -S react-motion lodash lodash.range
```

## todo-improvement
To improve todo with completed functions and better styles, with redux
```
npm i -S uuid redux react-redux
```
